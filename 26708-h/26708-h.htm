<p class="center">(<i>Scene and Persons as usual.</i> <i>The Conversation has already begun.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man</i> (<i>concluding a tirade</i>). &mdash;&mdash; so what I
want to know is this: are we or are we not to submit to the
Yankees? It's all very well talking about Chicago Exhibitions and
all that, but if they're going to capture our ships and prevent us
killing seals, why, the sooner we tell 'em to go to
blue blazes the better. And as for its being a
<i>mare clausum</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:150px;"><a href="images/217a.png"><img src="images/217a-150.png" width="150" height="255" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Who was she? What's
she got to do with it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>laughing vigorously</i>). Ha! ha!
that's a good 'un.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>nettled</i>). Oh, laugh away, laugh away.
That's you all over.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear chap, I'm very sorry,
but I really couldn't help it. There's no woman
in the business at all. <i>Mare clausum</i> merely
means the place where they catch the seals, you
know; <i>mare</i>, Latin for sea.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Oh! I should have known that
directly, if you'd only pronounced it properly. But what does
<i>clausum</i> mean?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, of course, that means&mdash;well, a clause, don't
you know. It's in the treaty.</p>

<p><i>Average Man</i> (<i>looking up from his paper</i>). It used to be the Latin
for "closed," but I suppose it's altered now.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>incredulously</i>). It can't mean that, anyhow.
Who ever heard of a closed sea, I should like to know?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>hazarding a suggestion</i>). It <i>might</i> mean a
harbour,
you know, or something of that sort.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> I daresay it <i>might</i> mean that, but it doesn't happen
to be a harbour (<i>relapses into paper</i>).</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, well, I only made the suggestion.
<span style="float: right">[<i>A pause.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Inquirer.</i> But what are they arbitrating about in Paris? It says
(<i>reading from newspaper</i>) "When Mr. <span class="sc">Carter</span>, the United States
Counsel, had concluded his speech, he was complimented by the
President, the Baron <span class="sc">de Courcel</span>, who told him he had spoken on
behalf of humanity." I thought old <span class="sc">Carnot</span> was President of the
French Republic.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> So he is.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i>. But this paper says Baron <span class="sc">de Courcel</span> is President.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, I suppose that's one of <span class="sc">Carnot</span>'s titles,
All these blessed foreigners are Barons, or something of that sort.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Ah, I suppose that must be it. But what have the
French got to do with the Behring Sea? I thought it was all
between us and the Yankees.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> So it is&mdash;but the French are arbitrating. That's
how they come into the business. I can't say, personally, I like
these arbitrations. We're always arbitrating now, and giving
everything away. If we think we're right, why can't we say so,
and stick to it, and let the French, and the Yankees, and the
Russians, and all the rest of 'em, take it from us, if they can?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Take what from us?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why, whatever it happens to be, the Behring
Sea, or anything else. We're so deuced afraid of everybody now,
we never show fight; it's perfectly sickening. But of course you
can't expect anything else from old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> That's right&mdash;shove it all on to old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>.
But you're wrong this time. It was <span class="sc">Jo Chamberlain</span>, one of your
own blessed Unionists, that you're so proud of, who arranged this
arbitration.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I know that, my dear boy; but <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
was a Radical then; so where are you now?<span style="float: right">[<i>A pause.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>who has continued his reading, suddenly, with a puzzled
air</i>). I say, you know, this is too much of a good thing, bringing the
Russians into the business. It says&mdash;(<i>reads</i>)&mdash;"documents were
submitted, on behalf of the United States, to prove that Russia had
never abandoned her sovereign rights in the manner suggested by
Great Britain." How, on earth, does Russia manage to crop up
everywhere? And where is this confounded Behring Sea?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>vaguely</i>). It's somewhere in America, or
Newfoundland, or thereabouts.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But how about Russia?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, Russia shoves her oar in whenever we get
into a difficulty of any kind anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>persisting</i>). Yes&mdash;but how can she have any "sovereign
rights" in America?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>haughtily, but evasively</i>). My dear fellow, if
you had followed the thing properly, you wouldn't ask the question.
There's no time now to explain it all to you, as it's very complicated,
and goes back a long way. But you may take it from me
that Russia has got certain rights, and that she means to make
things as disagreeable for us as she can.<span style="float: right">[<i>A pause.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Inquirer.</i> It's rather a rum start, isn't it? sending out Sir
<span class="sc">Charles Russell</span> and Sir <span class="sc">Richard Webster</span>. They're on opposite
sides of politics.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> That's just why they send 'em. <span class="sc">Russell</span> has
got to put the Liberal view, and <span class="sc">Webster</span> the Conservative.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course, of course; I never thought of that. By the
way, have you ever seen a seal?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> They've got one at the Zoo. Catches
fish, and kisses the keeper, and all that sort of game.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What, that big beast that looks as if it was made of
india-rubber, with long whiskers and a sort of fish-tail?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> That's it.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>with profound disgust</i>). Well, I <i>am</i> blessed! Is
<i>that</i> all
they're jawing about?<span style="float: right">[<i>Terminus.</i></span></p>

<h3>IN MEMORIAM&mdash;"THE DEVIL'S OWN."</h3>

<blockquote><p>
["Notwithstanding the efforts made by the Inns of Court Rifles, supported
by the Authorities of the Inns, to increase the strength of the corps, the
additional enrolments lately made have been judged by the War Office not
sufficient to warrant the continued maintenance of the corps as an independent
battalion; and orders have been given for its reduction from six to four
companies, for the withdrawal of the Adjutant, and for the attachment of the
corps to the 4th Middlesex Rifles."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, how bright were the days when we all of us saw</p>
<p>In their martial equipment the limbs of the Law.</p>
<p>With their helmets and rifles, and pouches complete,</p>
<p>(May I quote from the ladies), they "really looked sweet."</p>
<p>The Colonel, the Major, and all their attendants,</p>

<p>So now they're absorbed, and, no longer the same,</p>
<p>They lose by attachment their being and name.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH AS SHE IS SPOKE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>In the House and out of it.</i>)</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Committee appointed to consider the best mode
of reporting in the House, have decided that it will be advisable to
allow Members to have an opportunity of revising their speeches after
they have been "taken down" verbatim. The result of this suggestion
will probably be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>MR. SYMPLE-STUTTER'S SPEECH.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Verbatim Report.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, Sir, What I mean to say, I
venture to think is that the British Empire&mdash;yes
Sir&mdash;that is what I venture to think, and
<i>I</i> am a young Member. For I do not believe&mdash;no
not now&mdash;or in fact, when otherwise. For
envy and malice are together. I venture to
think that sometimes the British Empire. Yes
Sir, for the enemies are at our gates with the
past and the future. When the sun sinks&mdash;not
that it follows&mdash;at least so I venture to
think. You may believe me, Sir, that it is
farthest from my thoughts when the British
Empire and the sinking sun which I venture to
think is&mdash;in point of fact the setting sun, and
I venture to think the British Empire, and that
is I venture to think was my proposal in the past&mdash;which
has the terrors of the present from generation to generation.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Revised Report.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, Sir, at a time like the present&mdash;when the enemies of
the Empire are clamouring at our gates, when envy walks hand-in-hand
with malice, and our fate is in our own hands&mdash;we should be
bold and resolute. It is not for a young Member like myself to
point out the course that we should pursue, but I venture to think
that, by ignoring the terrors of the past with the courage of the
present, we shall avert the dangers of the future. It has been said&mdash;and
truly said&mdash;that the sun never sets upon the British Empire.
Let us believe in that sun, and find in its rays an earnest of that
glory which was the birthright of our ancestors, and which, should
be the birthright of our descendants from generation to generation.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Extracted From the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night May 1.</i>&mdash;Demonstrated in
Debate on Second Reading Home-Rule Bill that House may talk and
talk through twelve long nights, and not affect single vote&mdash;not even
<span class="sc">Saunders's</span>. To-night shown how a single speech may cause to
collapse what was expected and intended to be big Debate. It was
Mr. G. performed the miracle. Looked in at House on his way
from Downing Street, where he had received deputation on Eight
Hours Question, and delivered important speech. That might have
served as day's work for ordinary man, Mr. G., not to put too fine
a point upon it, is not ordinary man. Being here, sat listening to
<span class="sc">Dilke</span> with close attention. <span class="sc">Dilke</span> thinks time has come to
evacuate
Egypt. Stated his case in luminous speech; sustained his reputation
of knowing more about Egyptian Question than most men
except perhaps <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. G. made no outward and visible sign of intention to follow;
took no notes, and sometimes, as he sat with drooping arms and
closed eyes, seemed to sleep. <span class="sc">Dilke</span> done and down, he sat bolt
upright, looked round with almost startled air, "Well, really," he
seemed to be saying to himself, "since I am here, and no one else
is disposed to follow, I might as well say a few words."</p>

<p>Spoke for half an hour, without
reference to a note, and without faltering
for a word. Preserved throughout
that studious assumption of having
accidentally looked in which marked
his appearance at table. Evidently
desired to minimise as much as possible
importance of occasion. Subject
broached, he was, possibly, expected
to say something; certainly not going
to make a speech, much less deliver
oration. Carried out this subtle fancy
to such extent that, pitching voice on
low conversational tone, sometimes
difficult to catch full length of sentences.
This added to impressiveness
of scene. Crowded House sitting
breathless; Members opposite leaning
forward lest they might miss a phrase.
Everyone conscious that at the door
also listening were jealous France, the
wily Turk, the interested Egyptian,
the not entirely disinterested <span class="sc">Czar</span>,
and the other Great Powers concerned
for peace of Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. G., for all his affectation of unpremeditation,
evidently had in mind
these listeners at the door. To their
shadowy presence was, for him, added
consciousness of keen eyes watching
him from all quarters of the House;
some of his friends waiting for sign of
readiness to quit Egypt; the Opposition
ready to catch at any token of tendency to scuttle. Occasional
passages he delivered at rapid rate; but you could see him weighing
every word with due consideration of these manifold and conflicting
interests and influences.</p>

<p>When he sat down, there was consciousness that the massive
figure of important Debate that had loomed over House whilst
<span class="sc">Dilke</span> was speaking had melted away. <span class="sc">Jokim</span> and <span class="sc">Gorst</span>
had intended
to speak from Front Bench; great authorities on Foreign
Policy in other parts of House had proposed to say something, more
or less soothing. Mr. G. had left nothing for anyone to say, unless
it were <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span>, and the <span class="sc">Talented Tommy</span>, who,
sitting immediately opposite the <span class="sc">Premier</span>, had, whilst he spoke,
taken voluminous notes, only occasionally withdrawing eyes from
manuscript to fix them with look of calm distrust upon the aged and
unconscious statesman.</p>

<p>"I always like, when I look in," said <span class="sc">Marjoribanks</span>, smiling
beneficently from the Bar, "to find <span class="sc">Tommy</span> in his place, taking notes.
Gives one a sense of security. I feel, when I'm in the Lobby,
looking after things, it's all right in the House. <span class="sc">Browning</span> said
something of that sort. Don't remember exactly how it ran;
something in this way:</p>

<div class="poem" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> is in his place;</p>
<p>It's all right with the Empire."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. excelled himself.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Seven-leagued Boots not needed by <span class="sc">Talented Tommy</span>.
He moves about universe with ease and grace, unmindful of mountains,
regardless of ravines, reckless of rivers, oblivious of oceans.
Last night, Forty Centuries looked down upon him whilst he showed
how, in Egypt, Mr. G. is wrong, and <span class="sc">Dilke</span>, who criticised Ministerial
policy, is not right. To-night he stands on the Roof of the World,
a solitary, colossal figure upright on the lone Pamirs. His attitude
is of manifold mien. Defiant of Russia, suspicious of <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>,
patronising towards Afghanistan, he takes young China familiarly
by the elbow, and bids it be of good cheer, for <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> is its
friend. Since <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> crossed the Alps, and was caught in the
act by the brush of the painter, the world has not seen so moving a
picture as <span class="sc">Tommy</span> throned on the grandly desolate Pamirs.</p>

<p>House almost empty whilst the Talented One discoursed on
the subject. Mr. G., who misses nothing, happily in his place,
listening with eager hand at ear whilst <span class="sc">Tommy</span> spoke familiarly
of Asiatic rivers and mountains, not one with name of less
than five syllables. <span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span>, who really knows something
about this mysterious region, looked on in blank amazement at
<span class="sc">Tommy's</span> erudition. <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span>, who would presently have to
answer this damaging attack, tried to seem indifferent. But his
young cheek paled when <span class="sc">Tommy</span> put his ruthless finger on that
Foreign Office dispatch, out of which a line of print had been
dropped. This a Machiavellian device that had hitherto escaped
detection. <span class="sc">Tommy's</span> falcon eye had noted it, his relentless foot had
followed up the tracks, and he had discovered, on reference to the
original, that the criminally-deleted line of print embodied a reference
to the Oxus. That was all. "Only the Oxus!" he said, with
withering sarcasm. Then changing
his tone and manner, he shook a minatory
forefinger at the shrinking form of
the <span class="sc">Premier</span>, and cried aloud, in voice
strengthened with long warring with
the winds on the Pamirs: "Sir, the
stream of the Oxus has been entirely
omitted from this paragraph."</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. G.!" said <span class="sc">W. J. Lowther</span>,
present in his capacity as Ex-Under-Secretary
for Foreign Affairs.
"What with <span class="sc">Labby</span> one night and
<span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> the next, he has a sad
time of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="sc">Plunket</span>, sole companion
on the Front Bench. "It's a
hard fate for a Prime Minister to stand
between L. and <span class="sc">Tommy</span>."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Miscellaneous talk
on going into Committee of Supply.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Little difficulty arisen
in connection with Budget. <span class="sc">Squire</span>
faced by deficit of million and half.
This he met by expedient that will be
historical, as affording <span class="sc">Jokim</span> opportunity
for a popular jape. The <span class="sc">Squire</span>
has dropped his penny in the slot, in
accordance with directions, pulls out
the drawer, and finds there is something
more than the sum necessary to
balance the year's account. That is
all very well; but there are some
amateur <span class="sc">Chancellors</span> of the <span class="sc">Exchequer</span>
who would do great things with the odd &pound;20,000 or &pound;30,000
which remains as surplus. <span class="sc">Clark</span> wants Graduated Income-tax;
<span class="sc">Bartley</span> proposes Abatement on Incomes below &pound;200; whilst
<span class="sc">Grant Lawson</span> would let farmers off with half the proposed increase.
Best of all is, <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span>, who would straightway abolish
the tax on tea. The keen insight of <span class="sc">Alpheus</span> notes the little
difficulty about the deficit.</p>

<p>"The <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of the <span class="sc">Exchequer</span>," he observed, in his most
judicial manner, "may ask me to suggest another source of
revenue." The <span class="sc">Squire</span> pricked up his ears; the Committee sat
attentive. If <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> had given his great mind to
consideration
of the subject, it might be regarded as settled. All
waited for his next utterances. "That," he continued, in steely tones,
"is the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of the <span class="sc">Exchequer's</span> business. Mine is to
carry
out the Newcastle Programme." <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> thereupon
resumed his seat, leaving the <span class="sc">Squire</span> gloomily facing the dead wall
of his deficit.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Bill passed report stage.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Some young bloods below Gangway, on Ministerial
side, in distinctly low spirits. On Tuesday night, stage of
Budget Bill being taken, with ten minutes to spare, <span class="sc">Asquith</span>
nimbly moved reference of Employers' Liability Bill to Grand Committee.
Opposition, who want it referred to Select Committee, were
under impression Mr. G. had promised discussion should not be
taken till Thursday or Friday. Last night <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> protested
that they had been betrayed, and deceived. Young bloods below
Gangway disposed to chuckle over this spectacle. Mr. G., on contrary,
takes it seriously to heart. Having got Bill referred to Grand
Committee, positively agrees to rescind Order, and begin all over
again.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>

<p>"It's very seldom," says the <span class="sc">Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate</span>, in most melancholy
mood, "that our side show themselves capable
of doing a smart thing. When, by chance,
it is accomplished, Mr. G. comes along, and
coolly undoes it."</p>

<p>To-day, nearly two hours spent in discussing
question; Bill, eventually, remitted
to Grand Committee, as it had been left at
midnight on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Shan't play!" cries <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>.
"All very well for you, with your majority,
to bowl us over, but you won't gain any
time by it. You may take a horse to the
Grand Committee, but you can't make him
discuss your Bill."</p>

<p>It was only a week in the brightest of summers,</p>
<p class="i2">We played tennis and golf, and, when ended the day,</p>
<p>We made furious love as two amateur mummers,</p>
<p class="i2">Whilst Act IV. saw us One in the orthodox way.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">

<h3>POLITICS AND POLITENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I see that the Duke of <span class="sc">Argyll</span>, when he
received the freedom of the Burgh of Paisley, the other day, told the
following interesting story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I was going once to call on a lady in London, and when the door was
opened and the servant announced my name, I saw the lady advancing to the
door with a look of absolute consternation on her face. I could not conceive
what had happened, and thought I had entered her room at some inconvenient
moment, but, on looking over her shoulder, I perceived Mr. and
Mrs. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> sitting at the tea-table, and she evidently thought that
there would be some great explosion when we met. She was greatly
gratified when nothing of the kind occurred, and we enjoyed a cup of tea as
greatly as we had ever done in our lives."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, my dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, I have great sympathy with "the
Lady," and think (with her) the meeting, as described by his Grace
of <span class="sc">Argyll</span>, was mild in the extreme. If something out of the
common had taken place, it would have been far more satisfactory.
To make my meaning plainer, I give roughly (in dramatic form)
what should have happened to have made the action worthy of the
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Drawing-room. Lady entertaining</i> Mr. <i>and</i> Mrs. G.
<i>at tea. A loud knock heard without.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> (<i>greatly agitated</i>). Oh dear, I am sure it is he!</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>with calm dignity</i>). Do not fear&mdash;if he appears, I shall
know how to deal with him.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i> (<i>pale but calm</i>). Nay, my good, kind friends, believe me, you
shall not suffer from the indiscretion of the servant.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> (<i>pushing her husband into a cupboard</i>). Nay,
<span class="sc">William</span>,
for my sake! And now to conceal myself, so that he may not
suspect his presence by my proximity. [<i>Hides behind the curtains.</i></p>

<p><i>The Duke of Argyll</i> (<i>breaking open the door, and entering
hurriedly</i>). And now, Madam, where is my hated foe? I have
tracked him to this house. It is useless to attempt to conceal him.</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>laughing uneasily</i>). Nay, your Grace, you are too
facetious! Trace the <span class="sc">Premier</span> here! Next you will be saying that
he and his good lady were taking tea with me.</p>

<p><i>The Duke</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>). And, no doubt, so they were! This
empty cup, that half-devoured muffin&mdash;to whom do they belong?</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>with forced gaiety</i>). Might I not have entertained Mr.
and Mrs. <span class="sc">Joseph Chamberlain</span>, my Lord Duke?</p>

<p><i>The Duke</i> (<i>aside</i>). Can I believe her? (<i>Aloud.</i>) But if it is
as you
say, I will send away my clansmen who throng the street without.
(<i>Opens window and calls.</i>) <i>Gang a waddy Caller Herring!</i> They
will now depart. (<i>A sneeze heard off.</i>) What was that?</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>terrified</i>). I fancy it was the wind&mdash;the cold wind&mdash;and
now, believe me, Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> will abandon Home Rule.</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>suddenly appearing</i>). Never! I tell you to your face
that you are a traitor! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Sneezes, and hurriedly closes the window.</i></p>

<p><i>The Duke</i> (<i>savagely</i>). That sneeze shall be your last!<span style="float: right">[<i>Takes up a knife lying on the table.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2.5em;"><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>repeating the action</i>). I am ready, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> (<i>rushing between them</i>). Oh, <span class="sc">William</span>! Do not
fight!</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>falling on her knees</i>). I prithee stay!</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> Never! May the better man win!</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> So be it!<span style="float: right">[<i>The Scene closes in upon a desperate duel. Curtain.</i></span></p>


<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>There, Mr. Punch!</i> What do you think of that? Still, perhaps,
under the circumstances of the case, it is better as it is.</p>

<h3>THE LITIGANT'S VADE MECUM.</h3>

<p><i>Question.</i> Can you tell me the best possible regulations in the
universe?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly English Common Law.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is English Common Law accessible to everyone?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly, and if a litigant please, he or she (for sex makes no
difference) can become his or her own advocate.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When a litigant prefers to conduct a case in person, does the
proceeding invariably save expense?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not invariably, because a litigant may have odd views about
the importance of evidence and the time of professional advisers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When a litigant is afflicted with this lack of knowledge what
is the customary result?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That the defendants have to undergo the expense of a several-days'
trial with counsel to match.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Supposing that a journalist, sharply but justly, criticises the
actions of a man of straw&mdash;what can the man of straw do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> With the aid of some speculative Solicitor, he can commence an
action for libel.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What benefit does the speculative Solicitor obtain?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The speculative Solicitor, if he can persuade a judge and jury
to agree, will get his costs, and if the journalist wins he will find that
the prosecutor or plaintiff is, indeed, a man of straw.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any redress?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> None; but a wise journalist will never criticise sharply.</p>

to <span class="sc">'Arry</span>. "O' course," returns <span class="sc">'Arry Joker</span>. "Great! <i>'Ow

moment in Mr. <span class="sc">Albert Brassey's</span> life. It is as if he were Mr. "<i>All
but</i>" <span class="sc">Brassey</span>, and wasn't quite certain of what he should do next.
There is the writing-desk,&mdash;shall he indite a letter? If he does so,
shall he take off his thick-fur coat? Or shall he go hunting, since
he has on, underneath the furrin' fur, the pink of hunting perfection?
Likewise he has his whip and his horn, also his boots! He's
"got 'em on!" He's "got 'em <i>all</i> on!" Or shall he hail the
5,000-ton yacht that's lying in the roads just a few yards from his
open window, and go out for a cruise? He looks happy, but
puzzled.</p>

to let slip an expletive of three simple letters,
whereat Mrs. <span class="sc">Kean</span> held up her hands
in horror and quitted the room, followed by
the actresses who happened to be present.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
